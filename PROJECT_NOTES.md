# KM/CIF Curve Digitizer - Project Notes

## Overview
A web-based tool for digitizing Kaplan-Meier and Cumulative Incidence Function curves from published images. Built for HTA/HEOR work.

## Live URL
https://rphilip90.github.io/km-digitizer/

## GitHub Repo
https://github.com/rphilip90/km-digitizer

## Tech Stack
- Pure JavaScript (no frameworks)
- HTML5 Canvas for image display and annotation
- Hosted on GitHub Pages (free)

## Current Features
- [x] Image loading: drag & drop, paste (Ctrl+V), file browse
- [x] 4-point axis calibration (X min/max, Y min/max)
- [x] Multiple curve support with color coding
- [x] Click to add points on curves
- [x] Point editing: drag to move, right-click to delete
- [x] Grid overlay for precise placement
- [x] Zoom controls (+/-, mouse wheel, fit button)
- [x] Pan when zoomed (Shift + drag)
- [x] Live coordinate display
- [x] Undo/redo (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y)
- [x] Export to CSV
- [x] Copy to clipboard

## Known Issues / TODO
- [ ] Point placement may still be slightly off in some cases - needs testing
- [ ] Multi-curve point placement reported as problematic - may need debugging
- [ ] Could add: IPD reconstruction using Guyot method
- [ ] Could add: At-risk table digitization
- [ ] Could add: Curve smoothing/interpolation
- [ ] Consider renaming repo to something more discrete
